            "Hello Princeton!TL;DR: You're invited to a debate on banning TikTok TODAY at 5:30 PM in the Whig Hall Senate Chamber. Onigiri and other snacks from Mariuchi on us!------Following a wave of restrictions and outright bans on TikTok in other countries and U.S states, the Congress is now considering further restrictions, or even an outright ban, on TikTok, citing threats to national security, user privacy, censorship, and disinformation. However, opponents to the ban argue that banning TikTok would violate the First Amendment, and would fail to address larger issues surrounding how social media companies in general operate.You're invited to the Senate today at 5:30 PM in the Whig Hall Senate Chamber to listen to and speak on the arguments for and against banning TikTok in the United States! For more information on the debate, and on how Senate Debates work, check out our briefing at tinyurl.com/wctiktok. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to danielshaw@princeton.edu. Senate Debates are open to all members of the Princeton community, regardless of experience.

            " coming-of-age; this is a collection that shows what the body is, and what the body can be; unrestricted by form, binaries, and constructs. Novella | Frances sat on the subway & seethed. by Lara Katz Freshly smarting from her ex-boyfriend’s shocking betrayal, Frances seems bound to spiral—until the morning she runs into a nameless stranger on the subway, launching a romantic day-long exploration of Manhattan. They discuss everything from their childhoods to their futures as Frances desperately attempts to decipher this fleeting entanglement and parse out her companion, whose carefree manner belies a certain sorrow. Night is soon falling, and she—more than anyone—knows that some things are just too good to be true. In this compact and witty novella, Lara Katz winds through a heady exploration of womanhood and identity through whip-smart dialogue and sobering revelations. The unknown is not a dangerous force in this story; instead, it rejuvenates, provokes, and summons necessary challenge.Short Story Collection | Two Children by Katherine Ren“As we travel from a conversation of young souls after death to questions about our own soul future after moments of crises, Katherine Ren's short stories take us on an unpredictable journey, challenging genre and tone, always reversing our expectations. Hers is a daring and unapologetic voice that demands our attention.”  —Christina Lazaridi, Academy Award-nominated screenwriter & Creative Writing professor at Princeton University A soul-collector reckons with fading friends. The creatures of a fantastical nation are abandoned and rewritten by their disillusioned Creator. A woman who considers reconciling with her estranged mother is held up in a train station by a mysterious teenager. A girl tries to stay in her out-of-time, sepia-colored town against her brother’s wishes. A letter addressed to the reader ponders what’s been left behind. And two girls engage in bitter competition over a prize.   Through each tale in this poignant short story collection, Katherine Ren unveils layers of whimsicality and surrealism to contemplate growth and the loss of innocence. She asks what is corporeal and what is not; what truly matters and not; all underpinned by a consistent backdrop of imaginative duality. Two Children is unafraid to strike out against the reader, to force us to look back, and inwards—to resolve.<|endoftext|>What is the hosting organization of the event?<|endoftext|>"

However, opponents to the ban argue that banning TikTok would violate the First Amendment, and would fail to address larger issues surrounding how social media companies in general operate.You're invited to the Senate today at 5:30 PM in the Whig Hall Senate Chamber to listen to and speak on the arguments for and against banning TikTok in the United States!

            "Hello Princeton!TL;DR: You're invited to a debate on banning TikTok TODAY at 5:30 PM in the Whig Hall Senate Chamber. Onigiri and other snacks from Mariuchi on us!------Following a wave of restrictions and outright bans on TikTok in other countries and U.S states, the Congress is now considering further restrictions, or even an outright ban, on TikTok, citing threats to national security, user privacy, censorship, and disinformation. However, opponents to the ban argue that banning TikTok would violate the First Amendment, and would fail to address larger issues surrounding how social media companies in general operate.You're invited to the Senate today at 5:30 PM in the Whig Hall Senate Chamber to listen to and speak on the arguments for and against banning TikTok in the United States! For more information on the debate, and on how Senate Debates work, check out our briefing at tinyurl.com/wctiktok. If you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to danielshaw@princeton.edu. Senate Debates are open to all members of the Princeton community, regardless of experience.

            "Tech Entrepreneurship in the Fall of 2023 with Professor Chris Kuenne, founder of Rosetta and current managing partner at Rosemark Capital.Through Harvard Business School case studies, visits from entrepreneurs, and your own field assignments, you will learn the analysis and actions required to launch and commercialize a technology company. You will learn how successful entrepreneurs leverage their personal strengths and those of their team members to craft solutions, understand customer needs, build teams, enlist the support of sponsors, and scale their businesses. See what past students have said about EGR491: “This class is transformative. Whether you are a seasoned entrepreneur or a student new to business/tech, EGR491 will change you.”\"Absolutely take this class. It will challenge you and you will be so glad you did.\"“Incredible course. Professor Kuenne is an experienced entrepreneur and investor and he invites the coolest people to come speak to the class. The lectures are class discussions led by the students and gives you an opportunity to form an opinion and debate. If you want to do well in the class you have to speak your mind and participate actively.”“This class is incredible and life-changing: TAKE IT, no matter what your major or background is. It's fun and rewarding, and you learn a lot that will be applicable to your life after Princeton; Professor Kuenne is also amazing and is hands-down the best professor that I've ever had at this University.”“Debating case studies with some of the best students at Princeton is a really fantastic opportunity. It also helps to hear other perspectives than your own, since these are the kinds of people that you will be working with someday if you are serious about going into business yourself.”\"Professor Kuenne CARES tremendously about his students + their growth throughout the course! Highly recommend for students interested in learning more about entrepreneurship + how to build/grow a company.\"It has been one of my favorite and most engaging courses at Princeton so far and I encourage anyone who's interested to apply!  For more information, watch this brief video by Professor Kuenne, and if you are interested please apply for the course at this link. The application is due Thursday, April 13th at 11:59PM. Decisions on applications will be given back before course selection begins!

Along with his wise-cracking, hockey-loving friends, he begins working on renovations for the city’s ballet company. He unexpectedly finds himself falling for Dallas, a corps de ballet member in the company… and the girlfriend of his boss Derill Mafa. With his hilarious henchmen Morton and Goon, Derill Mafa will do whatever he can to thwart the growing relationship between Bobby and Dallas.
